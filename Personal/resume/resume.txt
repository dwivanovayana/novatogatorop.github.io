About Me

I’m a 28 years old Indonesian photography artist and entrepreneur with interior design and marketing background. In the beginning of my career, I worked for several interior design studios in Jakarta, then travelled the world and moved to United States on 2015.

During my stay in San Francisco, I started my own online business at NovaTogatorop.com where people could order prints of the photos I shot around the world. From choosing printing materials to the markets and events where my work would exhibited at, I managed and worked hard on every single detail. In addition to online printing, I provided high-quality photography service to interior design studios, also individuals.

My photography was featured in art shows such as Raw Artists in San Francisco,  national newspapers in Turkey, appeared in art websites such as Ignant Magazine. After living for a year in California, I left there to seek new opportunities around the world. Currently, I’m in Berlin and feel excited to use my background and skills for a business here.
